## Infrastructure and Packaging Files

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Dockerfile` | Builds one runtime image for scheduler, dashboard, API, and MCP roles |
| `docker/entrypoint.sh` | Validates `/data/config/settings.yaml` and creates required directories |
| `docker/compat/` | Thin image-only wrappers for previous Docker commands such as `python main.py` |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Default deployment topology with scheduler and dashboard, opt-in API/MCP |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Quality, test, security, and Docker verification pipeline |
| `config/settings.example.yaml` | Exhaustive reference template, documentation artifact rather than runtime default |
| `src/job_search_tool/defaults/settings.example.yaml` | Packaged copy of the public settings template for installed entrypoints |

## Test Suite as Specification

The test suite documents important behavior beyond docstrings.

### High-signal test modules

| Test file | What it really specifies |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_config.py` | validation rules, path invariants, legacy-key handling |
| `tests/test_search_jobs.py` | throttling, retry, search task semantics, dedupe expectations |
| `tests/test_database.py` | blacklist semantics, score monotonicity, retention protection, batch behavior |
| `tests/test_main.py` | boot ordering, save/notify interplay, notification eligibility |
| `tests/test_integration.py` | real score-partition-save-reconcile behavior and end-to-end API/MCP flows |
| `tests/test_dashboard.py` | helper correctness and destructive-action behavior around blacklisting |
| `tests/test_api_server.py` | API contract and filter behavior |
| `tests/test_mcp_server.py` | MCP tool contract |
| `tests/test_vector_store.py` | vector store add/search/filter/delete semantics |

## Dependency Structure

### Most central modules

The conceptual center of gravity is:

- `config.py`
- `database.py`
- `main.py`
- `search_jobs.py`
- `scoring.py`

### Adapter pattern in practice

The repository already exhibits a lightweight adapter/core split:

- core behavior in config, database, search, scoring, notifier, vector store
- adapters in dashboard, API, MCP, Docker entrypoint, scheduler shell

This is not a full clean architecture, but it is enough to keep most code paths
coherent.

## Modules with the Most Domain Weight

### `database.py`

This file is not just persistence plumbing.
It encodes product policy:

- blacklisted jobs stay excluded,
- bookmarks and applied jobs survive automated deletion,
- reconciliation is the operational meaning of retention,
- full reset is an exceptional escape hatch.

### `main.py`

This file is not just a CLI shell.
It defines the business sequence:

- when rescoring happens,
- when cleanup happens,
- when embedding happens,
- which jobs are considered new,
- which new jobs are worthy of notification.

### `config.py`

This file is not just config parsing.
It defines what the product considers configurable and what it treats as fixed
operational doctrine, especially around the persistent directory layout.

## Notable Design Choices by Module

### Search uses DataFrames early

The system stays in pandas/DataFrame form through search and scoring because the
source library already returns that shape efficiently.
Typed models are used mainly at persistence boundaries and server/UI output
boundaries.

### Dashboard is intentionally stateful and imperative

The dashboard uses Streamlit session state, reruns, and direct database writes.
This is appropriate for a single-user operator console, even if it would be
insufficient for a complex multi-user product.

### API and MCP are intentionally thin

The servers do not reinvent business logic.
They rely on `job_service` and the database layer, which keeps the adapters
small and behaviorally aligned.

## Modules That Encode Invariants

If someone wants to modify system behavior safely, these files deserve the most
care:

- `src/job_search_tool/config.py`
- `src/job_search_tool/scoring.py`
- `src/job_search_tool/database.py`
- `src/job_search_tool/main.py`
- `src/job_search_tool/job_service.py`

Together they define the meaning of search, persistence, cleanup, retrieval,
and exposure.
